The all black aluminum body and fast f2.0 9-36mm (35-140mm in 35mm) zoom lens is designed to maximize image quality. Manufactured with Extra Dispersion (ED) glass, the lens features fully multicoated elements with dual aspherical glass elements to reduce chromatic aberrations and deliver the highest image quality of any lens built for a digital camera. A variety of matched add-on lenses deliver the flexibility digital photographers need to maximize creativity.\\nThe Camedia E-10 has the features that professionals expect from an SLR, including Program Auto, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual exposure modes, a manual zoom and focusing ring on the lens barrel and a real focusing screen. The E-10 uses an Olympus-patented IR-active focus system for initial focus and a TTL passive focus for fine, accurate focus. Professionals will also appreciate the hot-shoe and PC flash connectivity for creative lighting.\\nExtremely easy to use, the Camedia E-10 offers one-touch buttons and dials as alternative means to change program modes. Rather than navigate through layers of LCD menu commands, the Camedia E-10 sports dedicated buttons to control shooting modes, flash, white balance and media card settings. Aperture and shutter controls are set using dials, enabling quick and easy access to a wide range of commonly used features and settings.   \n",

It's shaped closer to an SLR than a compact model. The optical zoom, however, is 10x - compared to 3x on a compact model. When compared to a 35mm, the SP-500 has a focal length of 38mm to 380mm. That's wide-angle to large telephoto, yet the lens remains extraordinarily compact. It's designed for easy use but has manual capabilities to let you exercise your creative potential.

With 2.3 megapixels packed into a 1/1.7-inch CCD, this camera offers the ability to create high resolution images as large as 1,800 x 1,200 pixels. You can print photo-quality images up to 8 by 10 inches. A primary color filter and auto white balance maintain the realistic images you want to create--grass stays green and the sky remains blue. The optical 3x zoom lens introduces versatility to your image capturing. It delivers coverage equivalent to a 35-105mm range in 35mm cameras. Your close-ups and portraits will have the look and feel of traditional photographs. The camera boots up in no time at all and the interval between frames is short so you won't miss a shot.   \n",
