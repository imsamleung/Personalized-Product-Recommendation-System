The (neoretro designed) DXB03 Studio Grade Headphones allow you to immerse yourself in audio bliss (while radiating an impeccable style aura). The naturally finished Bubinga wood housing delivers a wide soundstage with the perfect balance between warmth and crystal clear detail. The oversized 50mm driver is housed in a large vented chamber for deep natural bass response. The DXB03s are ergonomically designed with soft leather earpads for extended listening comfort, and a adjustable (brushed stainless steel) padded headband for custom fit and durability. The audio transfer cable is made with TPE coated fabric and oxygen free copper wire for maximum durability and sound quality. The cable is also detachable and has an integrated microphone for handsfree communication when incoming calls interrupt your soundscape.  "
